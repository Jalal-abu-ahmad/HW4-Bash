1. each article will take about half an hour, there are around 50-60 articles at any given moment so in total it will take around 24hours- 1 day 
2. this scripy can be used in order to search for any specific citations/mentions of specific words, and this can be especially useful when doing a research and looking for specific data or to locate scientific papers about any certain topic.
3.we can write a script which calls our script once every hour (infinite loop with an hour delay between iterations).
in order to prevent duplicate links we can keep a file that contains all the links and every hour sort all the links(new and old) and delete all those who appear more than once and then scan all the links. or to be more effecient sort the new links only and delete all the links that appear more than once and then compare the new links with the old ones, every links that appears in the old-links file will be deleted from the new one and only new links that werent scanned before will be scanned.
